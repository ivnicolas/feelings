# Feelings 
This Rails Application will help users find the words or feelings they have trouble expressing when it comes to identifying and exploring their own emotions. Through “checking-in”, which will be done by completing a short form, users can log their emotions and feelings throughout the day. The user responses to questions on the form can then be analyzed in order to uncover trends and patterns that can help guide them to understanding their emotions, themselves, and what is needed in order for them to feel their best. The goal of this application is to give users the tools to be more self aware or their own feelings and the behaviors that may contribute to their overall emotional state and wellbeing. 


## Motivation 
In my own mental health journey, my two biggests struggles have been trying to find the words to express how I am feeling and being consistent in doing all the things I need to keep myself in balance. The idea for this app came as I tried to figure out what would help me be better in these problem areas. I wanted to build an application that would serve as an easy way to remember to check in with myself and hold myself accountable when it comes to doing what is needed for me to feel my best. 

## Installation
To test it out, clone down this repo and run:
- `cd feelings`
- `bundle install`

To start the application, run:
- `rails s`
- copy and paste the 'listening to' address in your browser
